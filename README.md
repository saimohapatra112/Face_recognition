Face Recognition System
A comprehensive Face Recognition System using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter that supports dataset generation, classifier training, and face detection with a user-friendly GUI.

Features
Dataset Generation: Capture face images using a webcam, automatically labeled with user details.
Classifier Training: Train a Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) face recognizer using the collected dataset.
Face Detection: Identify and authenticate users in real-time with Haar Cascade classifiers.
Graphical User Interface: An intuitive Tkinter-based GUI for seamless interaction.
MySQL Database Integration: Stores user information (Name, Age, Address) securely.
How It Works
Generate Dataset

Enter user details (Name, Age, Address) in the GUI.
Capture 200 images of the user's face using the webcam.
Images are stored in the data/ folder, labeled with the user ID.
Train Classifier

Train the LBPH face recognizer on the captured dataset.
The trained model is saved as classifier.xml.
Face Detection

Use the trained model to recognize users in real-time via webcam.
Displays the userâ€™s name or "UNKNOWN" if confidence is low.
